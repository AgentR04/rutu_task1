## Task 2: Preprocessing and EDA

# Objectives for EDA:
-Use the given dataset to find underlying insights and patterns. Observe the trends
seen in the data to come up with an informed conclusion.
-Pay close attention to the data to find any anomalies and outliers which lead to
unusual inferences.

## Requirements for the task:
-Load up the data and perform relevant preprocessing tasks (checking the tendencies
of the data, ensuring cleanliness, etc.)
-Visualize the data with suitable plots, identifying the relationship between the
variables as well as the outliers and anomalies
-Come up with meaningful conclusions about the data based on your observations
