# Task 3: Model Fitting

## Objectives for Model Fitting:
- Accuracy: Achieve high predictive performance on unseen data.
- Generalization: Ensure the model performs well across data.

## Requirements for Model Fitting:
- Make sure that the data is clean and is applicable to a model
- The selection of the algorithm should be done taking into consideration the nature of
the data and the context of the problem
- Evaluate the performance of the model by employing relevant cross-validation
techniques.
